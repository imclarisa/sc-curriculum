## **Speeches**

Everyday there are opportunities to market yourself and pitch your brand. You want to be ready to shine when those moments come!

The moment dictates what type of speech ew can deliver. Sometimes it's a quick Elevator pitch, an introductory speech, or a full presentation. By preparing in advance for every occasion, you'll always be ready to deliver!

<br>

### Elevator Pitch ###
- What is it?
- Who is the target audience?
- What is your "Unique Selling Proposition" or what makes you difference from the competition?
- Close with a strong "Call to Action"!

<br>

Your elevator pitch for mock interviews should be (approximately):

A sentence about self / background
How / why you chose Savvy
Why you chose this capstone / what problem it solves / how you built it

<br>

### Introductory Speech ###

The introduction speech is meant for Demo Day. It builds on the Elevator Pitch. The individuals that come to Demo Day want to hear a bit of a “story” about you, how you got to Demo Day, and about your capstone project!

- Explain "Why" you created this SPA
- What business problem is the SPA solving
- High Level Summary of the SPA functionality
- How is this SPA going to solve the stated problem

<br>

## Full Stack Web Development - Things to include in your presentation

- Have you used Agile/Jira for your project (organizing your team Jira boards in sprints, prioritizing backlog items, creating user stories and then how you did the same for your personal projects)

- What role did you play using SCRUM? (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developer)

- What SCRUM ceremonies did you participate in and what was your role? (Daily standups, Sprint Planning/ Review)

- Being Agile certified

- Obstacles (talk about one and how you overcame it)

- Something you are really proud of accomplishing with your capstone (what was it and explain in detail the success)

- Technologies used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, Node, Express, Netlify, Render.com, Forms, debugging your code, testing and any others used

- Wireframes/ User stories (show them) project planning, research that you did, how you defined your capstone as your project (SWOT)

- Researching APIs and how you implemented an API into your capstone (did you create an API or did you consume an API which is using existing data)

- Future state - what do want to add in the future or how you want to change

- Show your code!

### Introductory speech Example: ###

 Hi! My name is Laurie Wilson.

 I have a background in IT Recruiting, Sales, and Leadership. I started my career in a technical capacity and was recruited for a new position. I decided that I liked the mix of technical and business, so IT recruiting and sales was natural to me.

 BUT, I have always been interested in coding. A co-worker who graduated from Savvy Coders had good things to say about the program, so I attended preview night and knew right away that the program was for me.

 I am a very health conscious individual, so for my capstone project, I decided to create a meal prep website that is meant for busy people who do not have a lot of time to devote to cooking. The website will allow users to indicate which type of nutritional needs fit their lifestyle and they can choose meal prep options accordingly.

 Many of the other meal prep websites I researched did not handle shopping lists very well, so I’ve included sections for dynamic lists that you can send to your iPhone or android for ease in the grocery store.

 I used technologies such as javascript, html5, css, etc……

 Now, let me show you what I’ve created!
