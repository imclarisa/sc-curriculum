## Homework is due to Stephanie by next Wednesday

1. If you have not done so yet â€“ create an account for yourself on www.github.com (name should be professional)
   <br>

2. Create your capstone repo (in a new folder) and add a docs folder.

   > **Important**: Remember to use the [Savvy Starter Repo Template](https://github.com/savvy-coders/savvy-starter) for this!

3. Create a docs folder, add all your project documentation in the form of markdown, images or PDFs. (It could be useful to create a separate **pictures** folder to collect images for your website)
   <br>

4. Update your README.md file -- using Markdown code -- to link to your new project documentation, and do a writeup of your project.
   <br>

5. Your documentation should include...
   - [SWOT Analysis - Project Planning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AS_I6aDUy3FHavmheb-jS2qiLrm1xrmr6Q1uVHQKaGI/edit?usp=sharing)
   - Definition of your audience
   - Definition statement (I want to create a web application that...) for your project
   - High level story (elevator pitch)
   - Outline of the content
   - User Flow
   - Wireframes (1 wireframe per page minimum, hand-drawn is ok!)
   - Color pallet
   - Site navigation and Nav elements like buttons
   - Any third party APIs that will be used
