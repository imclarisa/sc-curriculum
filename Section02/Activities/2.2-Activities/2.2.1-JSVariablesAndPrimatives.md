# Steps to complete creating a new file

1. Go to the terminal and navigate to your 'Activities' Repo your created
2. Create a new branch in your Activities Repo called 'development'
   1. In your terminal,type the command `git checkout -b development`
   2. You should now see development in parenthesis instead of master
   3. Open VS code by typing the command `code .`
3. In VS Code it is suggested you create a new folder called `Week2` for all the week2 activities
4. Inside `Week2`, add a new `.js` file called `2.2.1-JSVariablesAndPrimitives.js`
   1. Note: In the file name, there are **no spaces**. Computers don't like spaces so the name is written in camel case
   2. The suffix of the file is `.js`; This is because we will be using JavaScript

# Activity

## Copy the following code block with commented lines into the new file you created, and complete the activity:

```javascript
// create a constant variable (const)

// create a variable that can be reassigned (let)

// create three variables and assign them values of different data types (=)

// print the types of two variables that reference two different data types (typeof)
// TIP: console.log() prints a value in the console/terminal

// change the value referenced by a variable (dynamic typing)

// print the type of the variable you just changed (typeof)

// create variables and give them values to complete the sentences that will print  below.
// Which variables need to be created?
// What type of data needs to go in each variable?

console.log("Hello, my name is " + {add a name} + ", and I am learning " + {add a language} + ". I have been practicing for only " +  {add a number} + " weeks, so my status as a master is: " + {true or false} + ".");

```

## While going through this activity, in your terminal navigate to your Activities repo

### To print/view what you are working on, use the Chrome Developers Console in your Chrome Browser, or else use [StackBlitz - https://stackblitz.com](https://stackblitz.com/fork/web-platform)

## Pushing the activity up to GitHub (in the development branch)

1. In your terminal, ensure you are inside of your repo folder
2. Type `git add 2.2.1-JSVariablesAndPrimitives.js`
3. Type `git status`
   1. The file name should appear in green, saying it is ready to be staged
4. Type `git commit -m "JS Variables and Primitives"`
5. Type `git status`
   1. The file name should not appear, meaning it is waiting to be pushed up to GitHub
6. Type `git push --set-upstream origin development`
7. Type `git status`
   1. The working tree should be clean
   2. This means that the changes you have made are now online in your repo in GitHub
