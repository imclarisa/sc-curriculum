# Create a new file

1. Inside Class Activities, in `Week2`,  add a new file called `2.2.4-JSMorePrimitives.js`
   1. Remember, in the file name there are no spaces. Computers don't like spaces so the name is written in camel case
   2. The suffix of the file is `.js` -- this is because we will be using JavaScript

<br>

## Activity

## Copy the following code block with commented lines into the new file you created, and complete the activity:

```javascript
// create five variables and assign them values
// each variable should reference a different primitive data type
// REMEMBER: you should never DELIBERATELY assign "undefined" to a variable

// print the type of each variable in this order:
// string, number, boolean, undefined, null

// create a variable that references a template literal
// inside the template literal, use two of the above variables

// reassign the value of the variable that references "null"

// print the value and its type

// print a variable that causes a ReferenceError

// alter the previous line to no longer cause a ReferenceError
```

## While going through this activity, in your terminal navigate to your Activities repo

## Pushing the activity up to GitHub (in the development branch)

1. Open your terminal and make sure you are inside your repo folder
2. Type `git add 2.2.4-JSMorePrimitives.js`
3. Type `git status`
   1. The file name should appear in green, saying it is ready to be staged
4. Type `git commit -m "JS Variables and Primitives Part 4"`
5. Type `git status`
   1. The file name should not appear, meaning it is waiting to be pushed up to GitHub
6. Type `git push`
7. Type `git status`
   1. The working tree should be clean
   2. This means that the changes you have made are in GitHu
