# Create a new file

1. In VS Code, inside Class Activities, in `Week2`, add a new file called `2.2.3-JSMorePrimitives.js`
   1. Remember, in the file name there are no spaces. Computers don't like spaces so the name is written in camel case
   2. The suffix of the file is `.js` -- this is because we will be using JavaScript.

## Activity

## Copy the following code block with commented lines into the new file you created, and complete the activity:

```javascript
// Create a variable "timeOfDay" and assign it a string

// Create a variable "greeting" that references a template literal
// Use "timeOfDay" in the template literal to create a message like "Good morning!" or "Good evening!"

// Print "greeting"

// Create a new variable, but do not assign it a value

// Print the new variable and its type
// What type should we expect?

// Assign the variable a value that indicates the variable is purposely blank
// What value should we assign?

// Print the variable and its type again
// What type should we expect?

// Try to print a variable that does not exist
// What should we expect to print in the CLI?

// Print "greeting" again
// Will this line run?
```

## While going through this activity, in your terminal navigate to your Activities repo

## Pushing the activity up to GitHub (in the development branch)

1. Open your terminal and make sure you are inside your repo folder
2. Type `git add 2.2.3-JSMorePrimitives.js`
3. Type `git status`
   1. The file name should appear in green, saying it is ready to be staged
4. Type `git commit -m "JS Variables and Primitives Part 3"`
5. Type `git status`
   1. The file name should not appear, meaning it is waiting to be pushed up to GitHub
6. Type `git push`
7. Type `git status`
   1. The working tree should be clean
   2. This means that the changes you have made are in GitHu
