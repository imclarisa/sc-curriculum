# Create a new file

1. In VS Code, inside Class Activities, in `Week2`, add a new file called `2.2.2-JSVariablesAndPrimitives.js`
   1. Remember, in the file name, there are no spaces. Computers don't like spaces so the name is written in camel case
   2. The suffix of the file is `.js` -- this is because we will be using JavaScript.

## Activity

## Copy the following code block with commented lines into the new file you created, and complete the activity:

```javascript
// create a variable called "name" that references a string

// create a variable called "favoriteSong" that references a string

// create a variable called "wage" that references a number

// create a variable called "age" that references a number

// create a variable called "onlyChild" that references a boolean

// create a variable called "satisfied" that references a boolean

// create a variable called "favoriteThing" that references ANY primitive value
// print the data type of "favoriteThing"

// You heard a new song that became your favorite.
// Reassign the variable "favoriteSong"

// You no longer like the type of data stored in "favoriteThing"
// Reassign "favoriteThing" to a different primitive data type and print its type

// Happy Birthday!
// Reassign "age" to a new value

// You got a big raise at work.
// Reassign "wage" to a new value

// Your raise changed your job satisfaction.
// Assign "satisfied" to true

// use "console.log()" and "+" to print a sentence that includes two of the above variables
```

## Pushing the activity up to GitHub (in the development branch)

1. Open your terminal, and make sure you are inside of your repo folder
2. Type `git add 2.2.2-JSVariablesAndPrimitives.js`
3. Type `git status`
   1. The file name should appear in green, saying it is ready to be staged
4. Type `git commit -m "JS Variables and Primitives Part 2"`
5. Type 'git status'
   1. The file name should not appear, meaning it is waiting to be pushed up to GitHub
6. Type `git push`
7. Type `git status`
   1. The working tree should be clean
   2. This means that the changes you have made are in GitHub
