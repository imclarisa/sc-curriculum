# Create a new file in your ClassActivities Repo

1. Go to your terminal
2. Navigate to your Class Activities repo
3. If development is not in parenthesis, type `git switch development` in your terminal
4. Open VS Code by typing `code .`
5. In the `Week2` folder, create a new file called `2.3.1-MathOperatorsAndDataCoercionIntro.js`
    1. The file name is one word
    2. The suffix is `.js` because the activity is JavaScript

## Copy the following into the blank file:

```javascript
// What should we expect to print?

// Basic Math
console.log(1 + 2 * 3);
console.log((1 + 2) * 3);
console.log(40 / 5 - 2 ** 3 );
console.log(6 % 2);

// Adding/Concatenating Strings
console.log("10" + "5");
console.log("Hello " + "world");

// Data Coercion
console.log("2" + 2);
console.log(2 + true);
console.log(true + true + "true" + "false");
console.log(1 + 1 + "2" + "3");
```
