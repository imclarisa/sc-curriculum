# Create a new file in your ClassActivities Repo

1. Go to your terminal
2. Navigate to your Class Activities repo
3. If development is not in parenthesis, type `git switch development` in your terminal
4. Open VS Code by typing `code .`
5. In the `Week2` folder, create a new file called `2.3.4-TruthyFalsyAndLogicalOperators.js`
    1. The file name is one word
    2. The suffix is `.js` because the activity is JavaScript

## Copy the following into the blank file:

```javascript
// Logical Operators
// what do you expect each line to print?
console.log(true && false);
console.log(true || false);
console.log(!true);
console.log(!(true && false));
console.log(false || !false);

// Logical Operators and Truthy/Falsy
// ? what do you expect each line to print?
console.log(undefined || null);
console.log(!``);
console.log(!(1 && "false"));
console.log(NaN || !"true");

// Set the age variable below equal to a number,
// then use conditional operators to construct an expression that returns...
// "full menu" if the age is over 10,
// and "kids menu" if the age is less than 10

let age;

// Using only logical operators (no comparison operators),
// write an if statement that prints...
//  "The number is zero" when num is 0.

let num = 0;

// Write your if statement here *
```
