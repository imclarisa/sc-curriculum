# Create a new file in your ClassActivities Repo

1. Go to your terminal
2. Navigate to your Class Activities repo
3. If development is not in parenthesis, type `git switch development` in your terminal
4. Open VS Code by typing `code .`
5. In the `Week2` folder, create a new file called `2.3.5-Loops.js`
   1. The file name is one word
   2. The suffix is `.js` because the activity is JavaScript

## Copy the following into the blank file:

```javascript
// Follow the steps below to create a **while** loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) create a variable to represent the current number

// 2) create a variable to represent the current total

// 3) write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100


// Now using the same variables you created in steps 1 and 2, create a **for** loops that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) write a for loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
```
