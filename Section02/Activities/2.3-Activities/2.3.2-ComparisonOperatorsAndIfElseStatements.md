## Copy the following into the blank file:

```javascript
let age = 25;

// Write an If Else statement

// if age is greater than or equal to 25,
// console.log "Renting a car is more affordable."
// if age is less than 25
// console.log "Renting a car is very expensive."


// Chaining if statements: if - else if - ... - else

// if age is greater than or equal to 25,
// console.log "Renting a car is more affordable."
// if age is less than 25 but greater than or equal to 18
// console.log "Renting a car is very expensive."
