## Asynchronous Functions and APIs -- Working with Time

One of the hallmarks of an interactive application is that we, as developers, have a fluid interaction with time.

Events can happen at any time, in any order, and it's up to us to "listen" to and "handle" any event _whenever_ they end up happening.

Our SPA renders our app, waits/listens for a user event, then renders our app again based on the event, and so on...

Up to this point, though, we've been operating under the assumption that the only "delays" that might occur came from _users_, rather than from within _our own application processes_.

**But, what happens when we aren't sure how long it'll take for our code to execute?**

<br>

> **NOTE**: Remember, `setTimeout()` takes two arguments, a callback function that is executed after the timeout/delay, and a delay (in milliseconds): `setTimeout(() => {}, delay)`

Think about the following:

```javascript
function randomFinish(label) {
  const randomTime = Math.random() * 1000;

  setTimeout(() => console.log(label + "is done!"), randomTime);
}

randomFinish("function 1");
randomFinish("function 2");
randomFinish("function 3");

```

There's no guarantee that the `function`s would finish in order! The functions are not _synchronized_/ordered in time. **They are _asynchronous_**. When `function 1` sets a delay with `setTimeout`, JS does not wait around for that pause to finish before executing more lines of code/functions.

<br>

---

<br>

### **Activity 1: asynchronous functions example**

1. In your terminal, navigate to `Activities/7.1-Activities` in the curriculum
2. Using `node`, run `randomFinish.js` in your terminal - `node randomFinish.js`
3. Run `randomFinish.js` a few more times. Notice that each time we run the file, the functions finish in a random order.

How could we handle a situation where we **always** wanted `function 1` to fire before `function 2`, before `function 3`, even when we don't know how long it will take for each function to finish?

<br>

---

<br>

## AJAX web development techniques

Now that we have the basics of asynchronous covered, let's talk about how we will handle asynchronous JavaScript.

**A**synchronous **J**avaScript **A**nd **X**ML (**AJAX**) is how most JS applications interact with _data_: pulling information that can be handled by JavaScript from an **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface (**API**).

<br>

## ReSTful JSON APIs

The most common type of API you'll interact with as a web developer is a **ReSTful** (**Re**sponsive **S**tate **T**ransfer) **JSON API**.

This kind of API leverages the HTTP verbs that we've seen before in our work with forms \(e.g. `GET`, `POST`, etc.\), but uses a JavaScript-compatible data format instead of URL-encoded data.

To make more sense of this idea, let's take a look at an example API that's set up for us to make AJAX requests.

<br>

---

<br>

### **Activity 2: examine a RESTful API in the browser**

1. Navigate to [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and take a look at the documentation on that page.
2. Now to go [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts). What comes back?
3. Instead of returning HTML, this URL returns plain text formatted according to JavaScript standards. This kind of URL is called a "route" or an "endpoint", and it's returning data in JSON \("JavaScript Object Notation"\) format. What are the data types you see here?
4. What happens when you go to [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1) or [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/2](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/2)? The number at the end represents the `id` of the post returned. What are some benefits to constructing routes this way?

<br>

---

<br>

## JavaScript `fetch` API

If we're going to use data from an API like this one, we have to accept that there are going to be some _delays_ and _uncertainties_ regarding the acquisition of this data. There will be:

- time spent sending the request
- time spent retrieving the information
- time spent parsing the information
- possibility of failure throughout the entire operation.

Luckily, most **browsers** have implemented at least a part of the new [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), which provides an interface for fetching resources asynchronously.

Below is an example of a basic fetch request.

<br>

> **NOTE**: When we `fetch` data from an API, we must first "unwrap" or parse the initial response into JSON. With the data formatted correctly, we can then use the JSON response as a JS Object.
>
> ```javascript
>   // fetching our data from an API
>   fetch("url-to-API-endpoint")
>   // parsing our response into JSON format
>   .then((response) => response.json())
>   // "using" the formatted response in our script
>   .then((json) => console.log(json));
>
> ```

There's certainly more complexity to a `fetch` request, but the three "steps" shown above are the basics of using the Fetch API: requesting the data, parsing our response into JSON format and "using" the formatted response in our script.

However, while the Fetch API is certainly useful, there are some inherent flaws that come with it. The fundamentals that we've discussed so far are still valid, but luckily there is a library available to us that will accomplish the same thing and so much more.

<br>

---

<br>

## JavaScript `axios` library

The library that we'll use for the remainder of the course is called [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). It's like `fetch`, but works in _and_ out of the browser, has a number of more sensible defaults that are missing from `fetch`, and is just a bit more convenient for complex requests.

Let's try using `axios` to fetch some blog posts.

`axios` is a third-party library, so we'll need to include it as a dependency through `npm`:

```javascript
npm install --save axios
```

Let's re-write our `fetch` API request from the previous activity with `axios`. You'll notice that it looks pretty similar, but doesn't require `fetch`'s unwrapping/JSON parsing step:

```javascript
axios
  .get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")
  .then((response) => console.log(response.data));
```

> **NOTE**: We won't be able to use live-server to see this change, this is just an example of how using `axios` allows us to simplify our code. We will see `axios` in action later on in this section.

As mentioned above, `axios` is able to make an API request without having to parse through the data itself. Instead, we're making use of the `axios` method `get.()` to make the request, and then using the `.then()` method like before to "do" something with that data, which in this case, is printing out the elements of `response.data` to the console.

Now we've learned how to make a basic API call with axios, but there's still some complexities regarding APIs that we need to cover before we can implement them into our Class SPA.

<br>

<br>

## API Authorization

There are many open APIs, but most of them are not _quite_ as open as the placeholder JSON data API that we worked with earlier.

While computing power is cheap, it's not _free_, and most APIs require at least a little hoop-jumping to access their data.

<br>

### **Query Params**

In a RESTful API, a resource is usually accessed by name at a unique route, e.g. `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`**`/posts`** vs `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`**`/users`**.

We know that these are going to be different "things", so they get different endpoints. But what about when we want to add some extra data to our "query" of this resource?

One common pattern is to use a **query param**. You can see a _query param_ in action when you perform a Google search. If you search for "Adorable Puppies", your results page probably has a URL of something like `https://google.com/?q=Adorable+Puppies` (plus some other query params with info about you). Everything after the `?` represents a bit of extra information about your search!

Let's see how `openweathermap.org` uses query params to protect and refine responses from their weather API.

<br>

---

<br>

### **OpenWeatherMap**

OpenWeatherMap is a service that includes a free-to-use API that can give you information about weather conditions anywhere around the world.

This is pretty powerful for developers, but the maintainers of this API need some way of making sure that users don't abuse this system or bring down the API by making too many requests at once!

To manage traffic, OpenWeatherMap uses something called an **API key**. This is a unique identifier that allows `api.openweathermap.org` to restrict its responses to users with an account and to stop responding if users send too many requests in a short amount of time.

1. First, register for an API key at [`openweathermap.org`](https://openweathermap.org/appid#get). Hopefully you did this before class, because it takes a couple hours for the API key to activate!
2. Let's try to visit the API without a key. Go to [`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`](https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather) in your browser. What's the response?
3. Try again, but this time use an `APPID` _query param_ to access the restricted endpoint (i.e. `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?APPID=$YOUR_API_KEY`). What's the response now?
4. We're getting access to the API, but we aren't quite making a correct request. Let's examine the [API documentation for current weather](https://openweathermap.org/current).
5. Not only do we need to provide our API key as a query param, but also we need to specify a city (and chain our query params with the ampersand character - "`&`")

   ```yaml
   api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&appid={your api key}
   ```

   Let's add St. Louis as a query param:

   ```yaml
   api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=st%20louis&appid={your api key}
   ```

    > **NOTE**: When adding `St Louis` we use URL encoding to replace the "space" between `St` and `Louis`. The `%20` is the ASCII representation of a space. This is needed so that the API gets the correct info to pull the correct city data.

Now that we've seen an example of Authorization through an API key and how to refine responses using query params, let's implement `axios` into our Class SPAs!

<br>

<br>

### **Activity 3: Implement Axios and Setup router.hooks**

1. If you have not already, run this command in your terminal: `npm install --save axios`
2. At the top of your root index.js file, add the following import statement: `import axios from "axios"`
    - At this point, these are the import statements you should have at the top of your root index.js file:

    ```javascript
    import { Header, Nav, Main, Footer } from "./components"; // Added 6.2 
    import * as store from "./store"; // Added 6.3
    import Navigo from "navigo"; // Added 6.3
    import { capitalize } from "lodash"; // Added 6.3
    import axios from "axios";
    ```

    If we wanted to, we could now simply add an `axios` request to our root index.js and call it a day. If we were to do that, however, the `axios` request would only trigger when our root loads, which would cause flow issues in our MVU setup as we implement more views. We might also run into issues with trying to execute functions *before* firing a route handler. To solve these issues, we are going to use another method from our `router` object we created using `Navigo`, and this method is called `.hooks()`.

    In short, `router.hooks` allows you to run functions before firing a route handler, and these functions will hold instructions for updating information from an API.

3. After your `afterRender()` function but before your `router.on` function, let's create a new function with `router.hooks` and add the axios call inside of it as shown below.

```javascript
router.hooks({
  before: (done, params) => {
    const page = params && params.hasOwnProperty("page") ? capitalize(params.page) : "Home";
    // Add a switch case statement to handle multiple routes
    switch (view) {
      case "Home":
        axios
          .get(
            // Replace the key provided here with your own key from openweathermap
            `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=st%20louis&appid=fbb30b5d6cf8e164ed522e5082b49064`
          )
          .then(response => {
            console.log(response.data);
            done();
          }
      default :
        done();
    }
  },
  already: (params) => {
    const view = params && params.data && params.data.view ? capitalize(params.data.view) : "Home";

    render(store[view]);
  }
});
```

    - For more information about `router.hooks`, visit the [navigo - Hooks documentation](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/blob/e18744d8f79ec6fb654d426831a519cfc79aba44/DOCUMENTATION.md#hooks) page. We've provided just a brief explanation of `router.hooks` at this stage as it is more important to have a general idea of what we're accomplishing with `router.hooks` rather than exactly how is works. Understanding will come with repetition.
    - If you need to review switch statement syntax, go back and visit [2.3-JSOperatorsAndFlowControl](Section02/2.3-JSOperatorsAndFlowControl.md#flow-control-switch-statements).

4. Go to your console and run `npm run serve`. Open your dev tools in the browser after navigating to `localhost:1234` and click on the console tab. What prints out?

The next step is to learn how we can actually use this data! Remember, printing out something to the console only shows that we have access to the data, but in order to use the data in our SPA (Remember Model from the MVC Architecture), we'll need to store this data in state.

### **Storing Data in State**

So far we have been able to set up an axios call to an API and print some data to our console. While this step is necessary to prove that we have made a successful connection, now we need to save that data into State so that we can access and use it in our application.

The concept itself is simple and should be familiar by now; we are going to take a collection of data and save it to a variable. Easy enough, right? Well, in order to ensure the data is properly saved to state, there are a couple of steps added to the process.

1. Navigate to your store folder and open your Home.js file. Declare a new key called `weather` and assign it to an empty object.

    ```javascript
    export default {
      header: "My Home Page",
      view: "Home",
      weather: {}
    };
    ```

    Just like how we can access the header and view properties in other areas of our application (Header.js, Main.js, ect.), now we can do the same with this object called weather, and that's exactly what we're going to do back in our root index.js. Since we set up the `axios` call in Activity 3 and confirmed we have access to the data from the API, we can now format it! This doesn't just mean saving it to state, we can manipulate it as well!

2. Modify the content in the `.then()` method to manipulate the data and save it to state

```javascript
router.hooks({
  before: (done, params) => {
    const view = params && params.data && params.data.view ? capitalize(params.data.view) : "Home";

    // Add a switch case statement to handle multiple routes
    switch (view) {
      case "Home":
        axios
          .get(
            `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?appid=fbb30b5d6cf8e164ed522e5082b49064&q=st%20louis`
          )
          .then(response => {
            const kelvinToFahrenheit = kelvinTemp =>
              Math.round((kelvinTemp - 273.15) * (9 / 5) + 32);

            store.Home.weather = {};
            store.Home.weather.city = response.data.name;
            store.Home.weather.temp = kelvinToFahrenheit(response.data.main.temp);
            store.Home.weather.feelsLike = kelvinToFahrenheit(response.data.main.feels_like);
            store.Home.weather.description = response.data.weather[0].main;
            done();
          })
          .catch(err => console.log(err));
          break;
      default :
        done();
    }
  },
  already: (params) => {
    const view = params && params.data && params.data.view ? capitalize(params.data.view) : "Home";

    render(store[view]);
  }
});
```

    >**NOTE**: OpenWeatherMap provides temperatures, but they are all standardized in Kelvin! That is why we created a simple function to convert these temperatures, but as a developer you should be aware of exactly the type of data you are trying to access from an API. It might be the right information but in a different format/unit/ect.!

3. We've updated our Model(state), but now we need to modify our Home view so that we can see this information displayed on our Hope page. Import the information below into Home.js, and remember to call state in your default export function.

    ```HTML
      <h3>
        The weather in ${state.weather.city} is ${state.weather.description}. Temperature is ${state.weather.temp}F, and it feels like ${state.weather.feelsLike}F.
      </h3>
    ```

4. Execute `npm run serve` in your console. You will now see the data stored in state populating the template literals in your HTML!

Congratulations, your Class SPA now successfully requests data from an API, manipulates and stores that data, and populates that information on the Home page! In Section 7.2, we'll expand on what we learned tonight, but before we can do that, we need to talk about our root index.js file.

<br>

---

<br>

### **Order matters in the root index.js file. Here's a guide:**

1. **Import statements**

Import statements should always be at the top of your index.js file. These tell the code page what files and packages will be used. Without them being labeled at the top of the file, the code page will not know how to use all of this data.

2. **Declaring router**

Router is used to map all of the code logic to the location. Without this line of code your project will not be able to appropriately load the necessary data.

3. **Render function**

The render function tells your project to compile all of the files inside the components folder. In addition, the router function is called inside this function block to update the page links. The final piece inside this function block is a function for the Navigation Menu.

4. **Event Handler function**

This function should identify an event then give instructions. This will use the render function to upload the necessary page in the navigation menu

5. **Router.hooks**

This function holds instructions for updating information from an API. An if statement is given for a certain view (from the views folder) followed by an axios.get statement. This is then followed by an axios.then statement in which directions are given about which pieces of this data to collect.

6. **Router.on**

This is the function that executes the axios statements. This will only run correctly if given instructions on what to execute. It is for this reason that this function must follow the instructions laid out in the router.hooks function.
