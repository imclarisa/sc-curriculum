# Create a new file in your ClassActivities Repo

1. Go to your terminal
2. Navigate to your activities Repo, then this week's activities
3. If `development` is not in parenthesis, type `git switch development` in your terminal
4. Open VS Code by typing `code .`
5. Create a new file called `3.2.2-MorePracticeWithObjects.js`
    1. The file name is one word
    2. The suffix is .js because the activity is JavaScript

## Copy the following in the blank file:

```javascript
// bracket and dot notation
const key = "1";
const obj = {
  key: console.log("the key is 'key'"),
  1: console.log("the key is 1"),
};

// what will the following lines print?
obj[key];
obj.key;
obj["key"];

// Create an object with at least four properties, each with a different data type.
// Name one of the four properties "collection" and set its value to an Array or Object.

// Access a value in the "collection" property

// Practice with nested Arrays and Objects
const keys = ["key", "1", "method", "favorites", "list"];

// Add a method to an Object
obj.method = function() {
  return "the key is 'method' and it calls refers to a function";
};

// Fill in your favorite movie, number and color below
obj["favorites"] = {
  movie: "",
  number: 0,
  color: ""
};

// Add a list (a.k.a array) to an Object
obj.list = ["a", "b", 3, "d", ["e", 4, 5], { f: 6 }];

// Using the 'for...in' loop to iterate over 'obj' object ...
// how many lines will the following statement print?
// what do you expect to see on each line?
for (let key in keys) {
  console.log(`Key is: ${key} and value is: ${obj[key]}`);
}

// Use a template literal to print a sentence about your favorite things

// Access the values "b", 4, and 6 from obj.list


```
