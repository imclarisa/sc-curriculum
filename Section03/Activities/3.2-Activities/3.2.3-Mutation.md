# Create a new file in your ClassActivities Repo

1. Go to your terminal
2. Navigate to your ClassActivities Repo
3. If development is not in parenthesis, type `git switch development` in your terminal
4. Open VS Code by typing `code .`
5. Create a new file called `3.2.3-Mutation.js`
    1. The file name is one word
    2. The suffix is .js because the activity is JavaScript

## Copy the following in the blank file:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = [1, 2, 30];
let z = {
  id: 100,
  name: "myName",
  loggedIn: false
};
// reassign x, y, and z to FALSY values

// print x, y, and z

const a = "name";
const b = [];
const c = {};
// try to reassign a, b, and c to FALSY values

// using BRACKET NOTATION, assign a value to b

// using DOT NOTATION, assign a PROPERTY to c

// using DOT NOTATION, assign a METHOD to c

// using BRACKET NOTATION, call the method in c

// print a, b, and c
```
