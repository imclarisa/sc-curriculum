2. Navigate to your ClassActivities Repo
3. If development is not in parenthesis, type `git switch development` in your terminal
4. Open VS Code by typing `code .`
5. Create a new file called `3.1.6-Callbacks.js`
    1. The file name is one word

// "regular" functions
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello ${name}!`;
}

function welcome(name) {
  return `${name}, welcome!`;
}

function informAboutSale(name) {
  return `${name}, we're having a sale!`;
}

// function that takes a callback function as an argument
function getNameAndShowMessage(callback) {
  const name = prompt("Please Enter Your Name: ");
  alert(callback(name));
}

// pass each "regular" function into getAndShowMessage as a callback function
```
