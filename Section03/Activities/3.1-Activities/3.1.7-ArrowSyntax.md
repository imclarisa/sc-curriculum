# Create a new file in your ClassActivities Repo

1. Go to your terminal
2. Navigate to your ClassActivities Repo
3. If development is not in parenthesis, type `git switch development` in your terminal
4. Open VS Code by typing `code .`
5. Create a new file called `3.1.7-ArrowSyntax.js`
    1. The file name is one word
    2. The suffix is .js because the activity is JavaScript

## Copy the following into the blank file:

```javascript
// refactor the functions below into arrow syntax
function myNumberFunction() {
  return ((2 ** 2 + 3) % 4) * 14;
}

function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}

const timeOfDayGreet = function(name, timeOfDay) {
  return `Hello, ${name}, good ${timeOfDay}`;
};

function tripleAndHalf(num) {
  let triple = num * 3;
  return triple / 2;
}

function sumTwoNumbers(num1, num2) {
  let sum = num1 + num2;
  console.log(`The sum of your numbers is ${sum}.`);
  return sum;
}
```
