// TODO: using the function expressions below, refactor them into function declarations
const greet = function() {

};

const threeModTwo = function() {
  console.log(3 % 2);
};

let age = 18;
const checkDrivingAge = function() {
  if (age >= 16) {
    console.log(true);
  } else {
    console.log(false);
  }
};
```
