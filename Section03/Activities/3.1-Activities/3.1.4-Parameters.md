# Create a new file in your ClassActivities Repo

1. Go to your terminal
2. Navigate to your homework Repo, then Class Activities
3. If development is not in parenthesis, type `git switch development` in your terminal
4. Open VS Code by typing `code .`
5. Create a new file called `3.1.4-Parameters.js`
    1. The file name is one word
    2. The suffix is .js because the activity is JavaScript

## Copy the following into the blank file:

```javascript
// Named Parameters
// write a function that takes two named parameters:
// print each named parameter,
// then return the parameters added together

// invoke the function and pass in two numbers

// invoke the function and pass in more than two numbers

// invoke the function and pass in only one number

// change the function to set default values for the parameters

// again, invoke the function and pass in only one number

// Rest Operator
// add a rest operator to the function's parameters
// add a line to the function's body to print the value of the rest operator

// again, invoke the function and pass in more than two numbers
```
